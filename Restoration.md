## How to restore a database from a .bak file (GUI version)

Let's say I want to restore the database 1058 to an earlier version.

1. Right click on the Databases folder and click on **Restore Databases**.

3. Then navigate to `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup`, choose the .bak file you wish to restore and click OK.

4. You can see the .bak file in the Source section, and **1058** as the database name.

5. Then go to the **Files** tab, and make sure the **mdf** and **ldf** file name to be restored matches the database name. If it doesn't changes so that it matches the name of the database.
   For example, in this case, the mdf and ldf files are named TSQLV4, these were carried from the .bak file, we need to change it manually so that the Data folder gets the correct name.

### Post upgrade cleaning up

1. Go to the database property and change the Logical name...
